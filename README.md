# Senopi

<h2>Description:</h2>
Senopi is Android VR application for Oculus Go, Pico and phone/tablet. VR headsets can only watch what is being displayed to them (360 videos) while phone/tablet is admin panel where user can customize playlist for VR users. Application was supported by networking SDK Photon for this session management. Every admin user have own backend account where on website they can set what VR devices are connected to them or what videos should be available on theirs session. After admin app made connections with VR devices, all started downloading content required for session. The biggest challenge was making all those videos play smoothly on all devices and making encryption for video files to make it more difficult to steal content from devices.
